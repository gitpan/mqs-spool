NAME
    mqs::spool - Perl extension for management of spools

SYNOPSIS
      use mqs::spool;

    %spool = initspooldirectory($dir)

    $entire_file_name = newfilename($dir)

    $int = putinspool(\%spool,$content,$priority)

    $int = delfile($file)

    ($content,$priority) = readfile($file)

    @list_of_files = listfiles(\%spool)

    $int = putinspoot(\%spool,$content,$priority)

DESCRIPTION
    mqs::spool is a module for Perl to manage big or very big spool.

    More you have files in a directory, more the read or the write in this
    directory become slow. mqs::spool manage a spool of 32 directories (you
    can increase this number in the sources of the module by increase the
    value of $size_spool).

    A spool is defined by a very simple hash table. It contains informations
    about the seat and the type of spool (tcp type of spool will soon come),
    it is returned by the fonction initspooldirectory.

    It's better to run initspooldirectory each time you want to use a spool,
    this one will check if the spool exists and create or modify it (if you
    modified the size by default of a spool) if not.

    You can see the sources of test.pl to see how to use others functions in
    your source code.
